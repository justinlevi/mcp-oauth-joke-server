Create a detailed prompt that includes all necessary context and instructions, enabling a less powerful language model to effectively continue the task from where you left off. Make sure to include:

1. Our current position in the plan and the next steps.
2. Key insights and lessons learned so far.
3. The current understanding.
4. A complete list of all files involved in this work, each with a brief description.
5. The specific file paths for all planning and roadmap documents being used.
6. Mandatory verification protocol for all tasks.
7. Do we have tests that prove everything in this task works as intended and have we deleted and cleaned up any technical debt, dead code, artifacts, unnecessary ports or adapters, wrappers, etc. that we may have created along the way that we no longer need?

ðŸ§  ULTRATHINK MODE
Think HARD and activateÂ ULTRATHINKÂ for this task:
1. ULTRATHINK AnalysisÂ â€“ whatâ€™s really required?
2. ULTRATHINK PlanningÂ â€“ break it down into clear steps
3. ULTRATHINK ExecutionÂ â€“ follow each step with precision
4. ULTRATHINK ReviewÂ â€“ is this truly the best solution

Think hard before doing anything. Structure everything. Max quality only. NO SHORTCUTS. ULTRATHINK. AVOID DEPRECATION. AVOID TECHNICAL DEBT. MOVE FORWARD BRUTALLY ðŸš€
